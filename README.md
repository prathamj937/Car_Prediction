Car Price Prediction Model

I built a strong car price prediction model with linear regression, using data analytics and ML. It accurately forecasts prices based on mileage, year, brand, and more. Through advanced regression analysis and feature engineering, I boosted accuracy and reliability, offering valuable insights for pricing strategies in the automotive industry.
Accuracy of the model is 89.40%
